# Cifar 10 Autoencode and Classification
- The following projects use convolutional neural networks to classify and autoencode the CIFAR10 dataset.
- The CIFAR10 dataset contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes.
- [Here is a link to the dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)

### Cifar10 autoencoder
- The goal of this project is to create a convolutional neural network autoencoder for the CIFAR10 dataset, with a pre-specified architecture.
- I use the pytorch library for the implementation of this project.
- This is my unique solution to a project created for Mike X Cohen's "A Deep Understanding of Deep Learning" class.
- Much of the code is adapted from this course.
- Images that have been pushed through the autoencoder can be seen at the bottom of the file.

### Classify Cifar 10
- The goal of this project is to create a convolutional neural network to classify
images in the CIFAR 10 data set, which contains 60,000 32x32 color images of 10 different classes.
- My code correctly classifies the images in the test set 81% of the time.
